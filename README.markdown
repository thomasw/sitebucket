# Sitebucket

Sitebucket will be a threaded site stream monitor for the Twitter API.

Check back soon.

## Everything else

If you'd like to hire me, check out the [Match Strike](http://matchstrike.net/) site.

I looked to [Tweepy](http://github.com/joshthecoder/tweepy) a lot while writing this library. If you're working on something that needs to talk to Twitter, give it a go. You'll love it.
